CurlFtpFS
=========

CurlFtpFS is a filesystem for acessing ftp hosts based on FUSE and
libcurl. It automatically reconnects if the server times out. 

My motivation to start this project was to learn how to program using
Curl (http://curl.haxx.se) and Fuse (http://fuse.sourceforge.net). I
also wanted to maintain my website (http://www.golaberto.com.br) using
the tools that I was used to, like cd, mv, cp and vim.

As the FTP protocol is not very feature rich, this filesystem does not
fulfill every constraint of a real filesystem, but it should be usable
for simple tasks like copying and editing files.

Compilation and Instalation
===========================

./configure
make
make install

Usage
=====

curlftpfs <ftpsite> <mountpoint>

ex.:
curlftpfs ftp://ftp.sunet.se/ sunet/
